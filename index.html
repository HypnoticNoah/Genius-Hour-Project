<p><font size="4">I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code this website and small game. During Genius Hour class time</font></p>
<p1><font size="4">I watched videos about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get a understanding of the languages.</font></p1>
<p2><font size="4">After that I started researching more on websites with step to step tutorials explaining how everything works.</font></p2>
<p3><font size="4">Then I started practicing at home and made small websites to  practice.</font></font></p3>
<p4><font size="4">I also then started working on my small game. After even more research and practice I finally</font></font></p4>
<p5><font size="4">got the ropes and started working on this and finally finished it.</font></font></p5>
<p6><font size="4">Overall I learned a lot from all the research I did and I hope to learn more!</font></p6>

  <br>
  3. The gaming industry is worth 30 billion dollars more than the movie industry.
